	<p>It's scientific and it focuses on exploring universes, which gives the show infinite ideas on creativity.
Great animation.
Amazing adventures and hilarious satire.
Rick and Morty have the best voice actors. Justin Roiland voices both Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith, and he even gets himself drunk to help portray Rick.
Same thing goes for the Russian voice over translation, where Dima Sienduk (Дима Сыендук) voiced not only Rick and Morty, but also the rest of the show's character cast.
Rick and Morty also appeared The Simpsons through a couch gag one time, which might have shown the crew of The Simpsons might have done some research of the characters, and the show itself.
Crazy death scenes.
Easter eggs from Gravity Falls.</p>
